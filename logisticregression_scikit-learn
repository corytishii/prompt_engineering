#Logistic Regression using Scikit-Learn

#Dataset
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[0.5, 1.5], [1,1], [1.5, 0.5], [3, 0.5], [2, 2], [1, 2.5]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1])

#Fitting the model
#The code below imports the logistic regression model from scikit-learn. We can fit this model on the training data by calling `fit` function.

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

lr_model = LogisticRegression()
lr_model.fit(X, y)

#Make Predictions
#We can see the predictions made by this model by calling the `predict` function.

y_pred = lr_model.predict(X)

print("Prediction on training set:", y_pred)

#Calculate Accuracy
#We can calculate this accuracy of this model by calling the score function.

print("Accuracy on training set:", lr_model.score(X, y))
